When the user is not the curator, redirect to a page allowing to send an email to the current curator 
	with a description of the problem and the possibility to change the curator 

Register a domain and implement an email service (Who is paying? Where will be the website?)

Where to put the website? (DigitalOcean before builder?)

Limit access to Update and delete views to curators in views.py with decorators

Replace Version field of Topology by the refid or the request.user and the date ...

Potential problem with the size of objects passed as context 

Concatenate a file with all topologies per forcefield that can be downloaded from forcefield page

Limit the lipid name to 4 or max length to 5 (gro)?

When uploading a file, relpace the existing file if it exist (as it is done for lipid picture) 

Validation of new topologies with gromacs and the forcefields files for gromacs

Fill composition fields when a gro file is uploaded

Save a composition file, that can be downloaded or uploaded afterwards. eg.,  
     POPC   90.50000   UP
     CHOL    9.50000   UP
     DPPC  100.00000   LO

Create a unique membrane composition field
     uPOPC90.5uCHOL9.5lDPPC100

Rethink about the best way to handle membranes (two add buttons, top choicefield if gro file, reoder lipid according to %, ...)

Add biophisical parameters according to membrane composition






For the LipidMaps records with U, ISO and RAC descriptors, several topologies entries can be used (with a description).
The same approach can be used with lipids in different ioniastion states.
