  <h1>About Limonada</h1>
  <p>Limonada intends to provide an open library of lipid forcefield parameters for molecular dynamic simulation of
      membranes and a repository for equilibrated membranes, notably of more complex compositions representative of
      biological membranes.<p>
  <p>The structure, topology and forcefield fields are available on this website and new files can be added by
      registered users.</p>
  <p>The whole website, scripts and database are also freely available and open to modifications on GitHub:

  <h1>Context</h1>
  <p>Typical eukaryotic plasma membranes comprise several hundred different lipids distributed heterogeneously
      between and within the lipid layers and lipidomic studies have established that there may be more than 100,000
      different lipids, 40,000 are already referenced on the LipidMaps consortium database.<p>
  <p>Moreover, several studies of quantitative lipidomics have given detailed compositions of membranes; like the
      macrophage organelles specific lipidome obtained by Andreyev in 2010 which contain more than 220 lipids. These
      studies have been used as basis to build model membranes. For example,
      <a class="text-success" href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja507832e">Ing√≥lfsson <i>et al</i>. in 2014</a> have
      used more than 60 lipid types to define their model composition of plasma membrane with Martini.<p>
  <p>Different force fields exist for the simulation of lipid membranes. Although the number of available lipids is
      still often limited and thus limits the representation of complex membranes, two force fields, Charmm and
      Martini, have a much higher lipid number (more than 180 each) and allow to simulate the interaction between
      membranes and different types of molecules. The number of articles containing simulations of compositions of more
      than 6 lipids has also increased during the last years.<p/>
